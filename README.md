# TicTacToe


A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built in Java — made just for fun when I was bored.
Feel free to explore, improve, or remix it however you’d like.

I might upgrade it in the future using smarter logic or more advanced algorithms — maybe even some actual AI (not just a GPT wrapper). Stay tuned!
